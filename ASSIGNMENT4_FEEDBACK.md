Hi Ceridwen!

Wow, you really have build something super cool here! 

You've gone way beyond what was expected and delivered a fantastic result.

I've got no feedback for you besides this is fantastic. I love the use of the dialog and modal functions, you've clearly got a passion and dug deep into coding rersources to achieve this.

11/10, VG!

Well done!
